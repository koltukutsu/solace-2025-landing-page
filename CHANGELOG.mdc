## [2025-01-11] - Middleware Root to Turkish Auto-Redirect

## [2025-01-11] - Critical Mobile Viewport Fix

### Mobile Layout Issue Resolution
- **Root Cause Identified**: Missing viewport meta tag was causing mobile browsers to render desktop layout and scale it down

- **Mobile Width Fix**: Mobile browsers will now render at proper device width instead of cramped scaled-down desktop version
- **Responsive Behavior Restored**: All responsive CSS classes will now work correctly on mobile devices

### Technical Details
- **Before**: Mobile browsers treated the site as desktop and scaled it down, creating narrow cramped appearance
- **After**: Native mobile rendering with proper width utilization
- **Viewport Setting**: `width=device-width, initial-scale=1` ensures 1:1 pixel ratio and device-width rendering
- **CSS Framework**: All Tailwind responsive classes (sm:, md:, lg:) will now function properly on mobile

## [2025-01-11] - Mobile Hero Section Optimization

## [2025-01-11] - Complete Mobile Width Constraint Resolution

### Root Cause Analysis & Fixes
- **Issue**: Multiple components had width constraints causing cramped mobile layout
- **MainPage.tsx**: Removed `items-center` class that was centering and constraining content
- **FooterSection.tsx**: Replaced `container` with `w-full max-w-7xl mx-auto` for proper responsive width
- **Navbar.tsx**: Updated both desktop and mobile menu containers to use proper width classes
- **globals.css**: Removed restrictive container max-width breakpoints that limited width on tablets/large phones

### Component-by-Component Fixes

#### MainPage.tsx
- **Before**: `<main className='flex flex-col items-center'>`
- **After**: `<main className='flex flex-col w-full'>`
- **Impact**: Content now uses full available width instead of being centered/constrained

#### FooterSection.tsx  
- **Before**: `<div className='container px-5 md:px-8'>`
- **After**: `<div className='w-full max-w-7xl mx-auto px-5 md:px-8'>`
- **Impact**: Footer now responsive across all screen sizes without arbitrary width limits

#### Navbar.tsx (2 instances)
- **Before**: `<div className='container mx-auto ...'>`
- **After**: `<div className='w-full max-w-7xl mx-auto ...'>`
- **Impact**: Navigation properly spans available width on all devices

#### globals.css - Critical Fix
- **Removed**: Restrictive container max-width rules:
  - `max-width: 640px` at 640px+ screens (very limiting for tablets)
  - `max-width: 768px` at 768px+ screens
  - Similar constraints at larger breakpoints
- **Kept**: Basic container structure with full width and auto margins
- **Impact**: Eliminated the primary cause of mobile/tablet width constraints

### Mobile Experience Improvements
- **Full Width Utilization**: App now uses complete available screen width
- **Proper Responsive Behavior**: All Tailwind responsive classes work correctly
- **Tablet Optimization**: Devices between 640px-1024px no longer artificially constrained
- **Touch-Friendly**: Proper spacing and sizing for mobile interactions
- **Performance**: Reduced layout recalculations and improved rendering

### Technical Benefits
- **Future-Proof**: No arbitrary width limits that could cause issues with new devices
- **Flexible Design System**: Components can properly adapt to any screen size
- **Consistent Behavior**: All sections now follow the same responsive width pattern
- **Maintainable Code**: Cleaner, more predictable layout system

## [2025-01-11] - Critical Mobile Viewport Fix

## [2025-01-11] - Fixed Automatic Page Width Changes

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Primary Issue**: `floating-particles` animation on body was causing width fluctuations through rotating transform animations
- **Secondary Issue**: Missing scrollbar gutter stability causing layout shifts when content length changed
- **Tertiary Issue**: Excessive resize event triggers causing unnecessary rerenders

### Critical Fixes Applied

#### Body Class Cleanup
- **Removed**: `floating-particles` class from body that was creating animated pseudo-elements
- **Removed**: `overscroll-none` that could interfere with scrollbar behavior
- **Impact**: Eliminated transform animations affecting overall page layout

#### Scrollbar Stability
- **Added**: `overflow-y: scroll` to always show scrollbar space
- **Added**: `scrollbar-gutter: stable` to reserve consistent scrollbar space
- **Impact**: Prevents width changes when content becomes scrollable

#### Box Model Consistency
- **Added**: Universal `box-sizing: border-box` for all elements
- **Added**: Consistent box-sizing for pseudo-elements
- **Impact**: Ensures predictable element sizing calculations

#### Performance Optimization
- **Added**: Debounced resize event handler (150ms delay)
- **Prevented**: Excessive mobile detection triggers during window resize
- **Impact**: Reduces layout recalculations and improves stability

### Technical Details

#### Before (Problematic):
```css
.floating-particles::before {
    /* Animated pseudo-element covering entire body */
    animation: float-particles 20s linear infinite;
    transform: translateY(-20px) rotate(360deg); /* Causing width changes */
}
```

#### After (Stable):
```css
body {
    overflow-y: scroll;           /* Always reserve scrollbar space */
    scrollbar-gutter: stable;     /* Prevent width jumps */
    box-sizing: border-box;       /* Consistent sizing */
}
```

#### Resize Event Optimization:
```javascript
// Debounced resize handler prevents excessive state updates
const debouncedResize = () => {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    timeoutId = setTimeout(checkMobile, 150);
};
```

### User Experience Improvements
- **Stable Layout**: Page width no longer fluctuates during scrolling or animations
- **Smooth Scrolling**: No layout jumps when scrollbar appears/disappears
- **Consistent Responsive Behavior**: Mobile detection changes are now smooth and debounced
- **Better Performance**: Reduced layout recalculations and repaints

### Browser Compatibility
- **Chrome/Edge**: `scrollbar-gutter` fully supported
- **Firefox**: `scrollbar-gutter` supported
- **Safari**: Graceful fallback to `overflow-y: scroll`
- **Mobile**: Improved stability across all mobile browsers
