# Image Generation Prompts for Solace Hero Section

Here are distinct prompts designed to generate a hero image for the Solace landing page, each aligning with the brand's futuristic, abstract, and symbolic identity.

> **Note:** For each prompt, please generate two aspect ratios to ensure responsive design:
>
> - **Desktop:** 16:9 (landscape, e.g. 1920x1080)
> - **Mobile:** 9:16 (portrait, e.g. 1080x1920)
>   The composition should adapt gracefully to both ratios, maintaining the focal point and visual balance.

### Prompt 1: The Data-Voice Sculpture

**Concept:** A purely abstract and artistic representation of what Solace does: weaving complex data and natural language into a simple, beautiful whole.

**Prompt:**

> A beautiful, abstract 3D sculpture floating in the center of a dark void. The sculpture is a dynamic fusion of two elements: 1) streams of tiny, glowing data particles in pastel blues and whites, and 2) smooth, flowing ribbons of light in soft neon purple and cyan, representing voice. The two elements intertwine elegantly. The image has a very clean, high-tech, and artistic feel. Some parts of the sculpture have a frosted glass texture. The background has a subtle, almost imperceptible mesh gradient. Minimalist, elegant, futuristic.
>
> **For desktop (16:9):** The sculpture is centered, with elements spreading horizontally for a sense of width.
>
> **For mobile (9:16):** The sculpture remains central, but the intertwining elements flow more vertically, filling the portrait space gracefully.

### Prompt 2: The Solace Orb

**Concept:** This prompt aims to create an iconic and memorable symbol for the Solace AIâ€”a calm, powerful, and intelligent entity.

**Prompt:**

> A perfect, glowing sphere of glass floating in the center of the frame. Inside the sphere, there are swirling nebulae of soft, pastel neon colors (light blue, magenta, soft yellow). The surface of the sphere has subtle, concentric sound waves rippling outwards from the center. The background is a very dark, deep space with a faint, blurred mesh gradient. The lighting is soft and focused on the orb, making it the clear focal point. The image should feel calm, powerful, and futuristic. Glassmorphism aesthetic, high-detail 3D render.
>
> **For desktop (16:9):** The orb is centered, with sound waves radiating outward, filling the horizontal space.
>
> **For mobile (9:16):** The orb remains central, with sound waves and nebulae extending vertically, ensuring the orb is the main focus in the portrait format.

### Prompt 3: The Harmony Wave

**Concept:** This visual represents the seamless harmony between fluid human language and structured technology, shown as a single, transformative wave.

**Prompt:**

> A single, elegant, ribbon-like wave of light flows across a dark, minimalist void. The wave transitions smoothly along its length: one end is a fluid, organic shape with soft pastel cyan glows, representing voice. The other end transforms into a structured, crystalline pattern of interconnected nodes in a cool blue, representing data. The entire wave has a glossy, glassmorphism texture. The background is a deep, dark blue with a subtle mesh gradient. The aesthetic is clean, sophisticated, and highly symbolic of transformation.
>
> **For desktop (16:9):** The wave flows horizontally across the frame, from left to right, emphasizing the transition.
>
> **For mobile (9:16):** The wave flows diagonally from a top corner to the opposite bottom corner, making elegant use of the vertical space.

### Prompt 4: The Sentient Constellation

**Concept:** This prompt visualizes the AI's intelligence and learning capabilities as a beautiful, interconnected network of light.

**Prompt:**

> A decentralized constellation of small, glowing orbs floating in a dark, deep-space environment. The orbs glow with soft pastel neon colors (lavender, light blue, soft pink). Faint, ethereal trails of light connect the orbs, suggesting a neural network. One central orb is slightly larger and brighter, acting as a focal point. The overall image should feel intelligent, interconnected, and vast. The background has a very dark, subtle gradient. Glassmorphism and soft focus effects are applied to the orbs for a dreamlike quality.
>
> **For desktop (16:9):** The constellation is spread out horizontally, creating a wide, panoramic feel of a vast network.
>
> **For mobile (9:16):** The constellation is arranged more vertically, clustering around the central focal orb to create a sense of depth and density.

### Prompt 5: The Echo Core

**Concept:** This visualizes the core function of Solace: listening, understanding, and responding. It is represented by a core emitting concentric, evolving rings.

**Prompt:**

> A central, softly glowing core floats in a dark void. From this core, beautiful, concentric rings of light are emitted, rippling outwards like waves on water. The rings closer to the core are simple, smooth waves of pastel cyan light. As the rings expand outwards, they transform into intricate, geometric patterns of data in a cool white and blue. The aesthetic is mesmerizing, clean, and futuristic, symbolizing the process of turning simple voice commands into complex actions. The image has a high-quality 3D render feel with glassmorphism textures on the rings.
>
> **For desktop (16:9):** The core is centered, and the rings expand to fill the horizontal space, creating a sense of impact.
>
> **For mobile (9:16):** The core is centered in the lower third of the frame, with the rings expanding upwards to fill the portrait view, giving a sense of upward motion.
